<div class='box'><h3 class='box-title'><p>What is OpenWrt?</p></h3>

<h4>What is OpenWrt? </h4>
<p>OpenWrt is a Linux distribution for embedded devices and routers.
People use OpenWrt because it has the best combination of <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">supported router types</a>, 
the ability to run on <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms">embedded systems,</a> 
<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/barrier.breaker">up-to-date software</a> (both kernel and optional packages), 
and a vibrant community in the  <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/">OpenWrt Forums</a> 
where people use, develop, and find solutions using OpenWrt. There's lots more <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/start">on the Wiki.</a>
</p>
<h4>Why should I use OpenWrt?</h4>
<p>Your router will work better. Why?
Router manufacturers work with incredibly low profit margins so they often skimp on the development and testing of their stock firmware. 
Without naming names, most vendor firmware is buggy, insecure, and not well maintained. 
</p>
<p>On the other hand, we love to write software, and take pride in making <i>really good</i> software. 
People who use OpenWrt get tremendous benefits in stability of their network connection, 
rarely have to reboot their router, 
have excellent security, 
and often get higher speeds with low latency. 
The router just works better with OpenWrt. </p>

<h4>Is it easy to use?</h4>
<p> Yes. After you flash the OpenWrt firmware, you can use a web-based GUI to configure your router. 
Don't worry, there are <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/installopenwrt">good guides</a> 
that list the steps for popular routers. 
Once it's installed and running, most people can simply forget that it's there.
</p>

<h4>What's my next step?</h4>
<p>
  OpenWrt runs on hundreds of different routers and computers. 
  Most equipment (and most current routers you can purchase today) with a modern processor, 32 megabytes of RAM and 8 Mbytes of flash memory can run the current Barrier Breaker build. 
  The <a href="#earlier">earlier OpenWrt builds</a> are available to install on older or lower-powered routers or equipment.  
</p>
<p>If you want to try OpenWrt on your home router, read the guide <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/installopenwrt">Installing OpenWrt on your Router</a>.
</p>
<p> You can use OpenWrt on other kinds of equipment as well. 
The <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">Table of Hardware/Supported Devices</a> page lists many other platforms where OpenWrt runs. 
</p>

<h4>Why did you create OpenWrt? </h4>
<p>As we said, we love to write software. 
<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/history">We got started</a> in January 2004, when Linksys/Cisco released the source code for their WRT54G router (from which OpenWrt gets its name). 
We were excited by the opportunity to replace the Linksys software with a more fully-functioning feature set "right out of the box." </p>
<p>Today, you can start using OpenWrt without a lot of fuss or options. 
And it provides thousands of optional packages to add additional capabilities that aren't available with stock firmware. </p>
<p>
Furthermore, OpenWrt is built for dozens of different kinds of processors and architectures. 
This cross-platform capability means that you can migrate to different hardware if you need additional performance. 
And if you need to combine a specialized set of features for a project, OpenWrt's development environment allows you to create custom builds for any of the supported architectures and combinations of packages. 
See the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc">wiki</a> for details.
</p>

<h4>How can I learn more about OpenWrt?</h4>
<p>The Documentation page at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start</a> is a good place to start. 
You can also read the <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org">OpenWrt Forum</a> to ask questions and read current information about the project.

<h4>Package feed reorganization</h4>
<p>For quite a while already we are not very satisfied with the quality of the packages-feed. To address this, we decided to do a fresh start on GitHub. The new feed <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages">https://github.com/openwrt/packages</a> should be used from now on and package maintainers are asked to move their packages there. For the final release we will still build the old packages feed but it will be necessary to enable it manually in the opkg package list to be usable.
</p>
<p>Additionally we would like to give a big thank you to all of our package maintainers working on our various feeds.</p>

<h4>New build servers</h4>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to Imagination Technology for funding the 2 build servers that we used for the release.</p>

<h4>Whats next ?</h4>
We aim at releasing Chaos Calmer (CC) before the end of the year. The CC release will use 3.14 or a newer LTS kernel as baseline.</p>
<p>Have fun!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The OpenWrt developer team</p>
