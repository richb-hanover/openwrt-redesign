<h4>About this page...</h4>
<i>This page is a draft of a re-designed home page for the OpenWrt project. It attempts to preserve all the important and timely information, as well as reassuring people who are new to the project that OpenWrt would be a good choice for them. Please place any comments about this page on the Forum in the <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=276600#p276600">Initiate to improve OpenWrt documentation</a> page.

<div class='box'><h3 class='box-title'><p>What is OpenWrt?</p></h3>

<h4>What is OpenWrt? </h4>
<p>OpenWrt is a Linux distribution for embedded devices and routers.
People use OpenWrt because it has the best combination of <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">supported router types</a>, the ability to run on <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms">embedded systems,</a> <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/barrier.breaker">up-to-date software</a> (both kernel and packages), and the <a href="http://forums.openwrt.org/">OpenWrt Forums</a> provide a vibrant community of people who're using, developing, and finding solutions for OpenWrt.  
</p>
<h4>Why should I use OpenWrt?</h4>
<p>Router manufacturers suffer from incredibly low profit margins, so frequently they skimp on the development and testing of their stock firmware. 
Without naming names, most vendor firmware is buggy, insecure, and not well maintained. 
</p>

<p>On the other hand, we love to write software, and take pride in making <i>really good</i> software. People who use OpenWrt get tremendous benefits in stability of their network connection, rarely have to reboot their router, have excellent security (with timely updates as needed), and often get higher speeds with low latency. Their router just works better. </p>

<h4>Is it easy to use?</h4>
<p> Yes. After you flash the OpenWrt firmware, you can use a web-based GUI to configure your router. 
Don't worry, there are <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/installopenwrt">good guides</a> that list the steps for popular routers. Once it's installed and running, most people can simply forget that it's there.
</p>

<h4>What's the next step?</h4>
<p>
  OpenWrt runs on hundreds of different routers and computers. Most equipment (and most current routers you can purchase today) with a modern processor, 32 megabytes of RAM and 8 Mbytes of flash memory can run the current Barrier Breaker build. Earlier builds can run on lower-powered routers or equipment.  
</p>
<p>If you want to try OpenWrt on your home router, read the guide at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/installopenwrt">Installing OpenWrt on your Router</a>.
</p>
<p> You can use OpenWrt on other kinds of equipment as well. The <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">Table of Hardware/Supported Devices</a> page lists many other platforms where OpenWrt runs. 
</p>

<h4>Why did you create OpenWrt? </h4>
<p>As we said, we love to write software. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/history">We got started</a> in January 2004, when Linksys/Cisco released the source code for their WRT54G router (from which OpenWrt gets its name). We were excited by the opportunity to replace the Linksys software with a more fully-functioning feature set "right out of the box." </p>
<p>Today, you can starting using OpenWrt without a lot of fuss or options. But it provides thousands of optional packages to add additional capabilities that aren't available with lot of stock firmware. </p>
<p>
Furthermore, OpenWrt is built for dozens of different kinds of processors and architectures. 
This cross-platform capability means that you can migrate to different hardware if you need additional performance. 
And if you need to develop a specialized set of features for a project, OpenWrt's build environment allows you to create custom builds for any of the supported architectures and combinations of packages. 
See the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc">wiki</a> for details.
</p>

<h4>How can I learn more about OpenWrt?</h4>
<p>The Documentation page at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start</a> is a good place to start. You can also read the <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org">OpenWrt Forum</a> to ask questions and read current information about the project.

<h4>Package feed reorganization</h4>
<p>For quite a while already we are not very satisfied with the quality<br />of the packages-feed. To address this, we decided to do a fresh start<br />on GitHub. The new feed <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages">https://github.com/openwrt/packages</a> should be<br />used from now on and package maintainers are asked to move their<br />packages there. For the final release we will still build the old<br />packages feed but it will be necessary to enable it manually in the<br />opkg package list to be usable.
</p>
<p>Additionally we would like to give a big thank you to all of our package<br />maintainers working on our various feeds.</p>

<h4>New build servers</h4>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to Imagination Technology for<br />funding the 2 build servers that we used for the release.</p>

<h4>Whats next ?</h4>
We aim at releasing Chaos Calmer (CC) before the end of the year. The<br />CC release will use 3.14 or a newer LTS kernel as baseline.</p><br /><br /><p>Have fun!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The OpenWrt developer team</p>
